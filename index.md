### piControl
The number of El Nino events in Nino1+2 is the smallest among the 4 indices (603 months), and it increases as it goes to the west (703, 763, and 848, respectively). About La Nina events, there is no clear relationship among the indices. In Nino4, the composit El Nino and La Nina show the center of SST anomalies along the equator shifts slightly westward than other indices. Fig 3 shows the distribution of linear regression between each index and global SST anomalies. All of indices show there are strong rpositive correlations between them along the equatorial Pacific in both El Nino and La Nina events. Thus, it means that when each of index show El Nino (La Nina) events, there are also warm (cold) SST anomalies along the equatorial Pacific. Conversely, all of indices show negative correlations with the Maritime Continents SST anomalies. There are 2 pairs among the indices in terms of the correlation distribution. Nino1+2 and Nino4 show similar patterns, while Nino3 and Nino3.4 show similar patterns as well.

Fig 3 shows the linear regression analysis between each index and the global SST anomalies in piControl. Comparing the regression of El Nino to La Nina, the area of pronounced positive correlation along the equator is meridionally shrinked in the regression of La Nina in all indices. Zonally, however, the latter one is more extensive to the west than the former one. In El Nino plots, there are strong positive correlations (r >=0.5 or <=-0.5) in the South Pacific, west coast of the North America which is only in Nino4, and some coastal areas, while negative correlation in the North Pacific, the Maritime continent, and the SPCZ zone. From La Nina plots, we can see the similar charactersitics, but it is less clear.

### midHolocene
As we see in the piControl outputs, the number of El Nino events increase from Nino1+2 to Nino4 (621, 674, 711, 764, respectively). All of indices show decreased number of El Nino events in the mid-Holocene.

Fig 5 shows the linear regression analysis between each index and the global SST anomalies in the mid-Holocene. Comparing the regression of El Nino to La Nina, the area of pronounced positive correlation along the equator is meridionally shrinked in the regression of La Nina in all indices. Zonally, however, the latter one is more extensive than the former one. In El Nino plots, there are strong positive correlations (r >=0.5 or <=-0.5) in the South Pacific, west coast of the North America, and Indian Ocean, while negative correlation in the North Pacific, the Maritime continent, and the SPCZ zone. From La Nina plots, we can see the similar charactersitics, but it is less clear.
